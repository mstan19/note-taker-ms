## Description of the Project
This application can dynamically update the notes, where it can add and delete notes. Node.js and Express (verison 4.16.4) was used to run the application. This application requires you to understand package.json and its node_modules. In additon to that, gitignore file is important to use so certain folders and files are not upload to GitHub. For example, node_modules should not be uploaded to GitHub since this folder gets created during the installition process. Lastly, by creating a server the user does not rely on a local storage to save user's notes where the user can add and delete more than one note.


## Installation
To create this project, follow these several steps. This application uses Node.js and Express (verison 4.16.4) and nodemon (verison 2.0.19). Step one, download Node.js. Next go to the terminal of the index.js and type this command ```npm install```. This creates package.json file. 


## Usage
To use this application, open the terminal, respective to the file. Run the ```nodemon server.js``` in the terminal. Finally, the Database will be updated with recent notes. 

This is what the index.html will look like when deployed.
